# Curate-Ipsum

**Graph-spectral framework for verified code synthesis through belief revision**

Curate-Ipsum is an MCP server that bridges the gap between LLM-generated code
(fast, plausible, unverified) and formally verified patches (slow, correct,
trustworthy). It treats mutation testing as input to a CEGIS/CEGAR synthesis
loop powered by belief revision, graph-spectral analysis, and RAG-augmented
context retrieval.
